Welcome to SeriesFav, a powerful app developed during my apprenticeship at Linnify. While it may appear simple at first glance, SeriesFav is packed with robust features including a well-organized structure, global and local state management, authentication, and more. This app serves as a comprehensive list of series sourced from an API, allowing users to favorite their preferred series, make account-related changes, and more.

# Technologies Used
SeriesFav utilizes the following technologies and libraries:

•	This journey involved mastering the art of code structuring and delving into the depths of TypeScript along with exploring various features offered by React Native

•	We used Zustand: localStorage , AsyncStorage , IndexedDB + MMKV

•	Animations with Reanimated, hooks like debounce, SVG handling, modal management, local/global storage manipulation, proper navigation setup, authentication implementation, JSON handling, and API data fetching.

•	This experience underscored the importance of clean, readable code and effective teamwork in application development.

# Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to the team at Linnify for providing me with the opportunity to work on this project during my apprenticeship. Their guidance and support were invaluable in creating SeriesFav.

# Design
I'm very proud of myself for this design, this was straight freestyle.
