Welcome to SeriesFav, a powerful app developed during my apprenticeship at Linnify. While it may appear simple at first glance, SeriesFav is packed with robust features including a well-organized structure, global and local state management, authentication, and more. This app serves as a comprehensive list of series sourced from an API, allowing users to favorite their preferred series, make account-related changes, and more.

# Technologies Used
SeriesFav utilizes the following technologies and libraries:

React-Native: With typescript
Zustand: The Persist middleware enables you to store your Zustand state in a storage (e.g., localStorage , AsyncStorage , IndexedDB)
MMKV: local storage

# Design
I'm very proud of myself for this desing, this was straight freestyle.
