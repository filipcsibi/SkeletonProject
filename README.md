Welcome to SeriesFav, a powerful app developed during my apprenticeship at Linnify. While it may appear simple at first glance, SeriesFav is packed with robust features including a well-organized structure, global and local state management, authentication, and more. This app serves as a comprehensive list of series sourced from an API, allowing users to favorite their preferred series, make account-related changes, and more.

# Technologies Used
SeriesFav utilizes the following technologies and libraries:

React-Native: With typescript
Zustand: The Persist middleware enables you to store your Zustand state in a storage (e.g., localStorage , AsyncStorage , IndexedDB)
MMKV: local storage

# Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to the team at Linnify for providing me with the opportunity to work on this project during my apprenticeship. Their guidance and support were invaluable in creating SeriesFav.

# Design
I'm very proud of myself for this desing, this was straight freestyle.
